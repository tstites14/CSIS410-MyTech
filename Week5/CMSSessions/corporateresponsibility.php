            <h2>Our Donations</h2>
            <p>We have donated to <a href="thewaterproject.org">The Water Project</a> to provide water to struggling communities in Africa. As a part of our company's Christian heritage, it is important that we donate to causes that make the lives of people around the world better.</p>
            <p>We have also donated to <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/">Feeding America</a>, a food bank that feeds millions of Americans every year. As Christians, it is our responsibility to follow the example of Jesus. One aspect of that is feeding the poor, and supporting Feeding America enables that.</p>
